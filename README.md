You MUST have a DVB-T tuner to make this work!

---=== Instructions ===---

- Boot with DVB-T card inserted.
- On installations other than OSMC, use your package manager to install rtl-sdr (for the FM tuner dongle), and lame (for mp3 encoding) 
  package (dependancies).  I tried to automate this from within Kodi, but it will only work on OSMC.
- Install ZIP file of this file's directory inside Kodi
- Click Yes
- Station and Decimal - If the station is 103.3 type 103 in the first box, 3 in the second box, 
  hit ok and it should tune to the selected frequency and play sound.
- Go to the music tab and stop to hault playback.

Install the zip file and cross fingers...

---=== Tested setups ===---

1. Rasperry Pi 3+ running OSMC in Kodi 18.5 with a NooElec R820T USB Adapter.
